            <p>FromSoftware, Inc. is a Japanese video game development and publishing company based in Tokyo. Founded by Naotoshi Zin in November 1986, the company developed business software before releasing their first video game, King's Field, in 1994.
                The company would achieve breakout success in the 2010s, spurred by Demon's Souls (2009) and Dark Souls (2011), the latter being the first entry in a trilogy whose success led to the creation of a subgenre of action role-playing games known as Soulslikes. These include Bloodborne (2015), Sekiro (2019), and Elden Ring (2022).

                <h5>Demon's souls</h5>
                <p>The original Soulsborne. A bit old but still a great game but it has a visual remake if old graphics are a problem. It is rather slow compared with the others.</p>

                <p>This one is probably the best entry point, It is the spiritual successor of Demon souls. There are 3 of them so definitely the most content.</p>

                <p>A victorian H.P Lovecraft inspired RPG with fast pace and precise combat. The haunting, gothic environment creates a special atmosphere found nowhere else.</p>

                <p>The only japanese inspired game in the franchise so far. Sekiro has a very fast pace and high skill floor and vibrant atmosphere. It is probably the hardest one in the group.</p>

                <p>The latest game (as of writing) in the series. it is the culmination of all the development experience Fromsoft has. the core is similar to Dark souls. go play it!</p>

                <h5>Armored core</h5>
                <p>The only sci-fi entry. there are 5 of them but most are quite old. It is probably the game that allows the most customizability as you'll have a big robot to decorate. new one coming late 2023.</p>

                <p>Most modern development companies prefer to make their games accessible to as many people as possible, which in turn means that means that most modern games offer up no challenge. from software never followed that rule, they make games that are meant to challenge the player. <br><br> Another way From Software differentiate themselves from their competitors is in the way they allow you to miss content which is in stark contrast to most game devs who seem to be afraid that the player would miss anything in the first playthrough.</p>

                <p>The Soulsborne games are well known for their vast amounts of lore and backstory but very light storytelling. these games prefer to tell their story thorough the architecture and the environment. another way the Soulsborne games tell there story is with by giving every item a description to tie it to the world. these systems that everyone would know some of the story but to know more one would have to look.</p>
